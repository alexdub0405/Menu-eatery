    <div class="first">
      <p>
        Sea Trout Tartare <span class="price">$10</span><br /><small
          >Even with roe clusters and meyer lemon jelly in the mix, the lightly-smoked flavor of the sea trout still comes through clearly in this
          tartar. It arrives in a palm-sized circle held together by a thin border of black pepper cracker, and a server pours a bit of vodka crème
          fraîche around the edge. We kept thinking about how good this would be with a bagel for breakfast.</small

    <div class="second">
      <p>
        Tuna With Foie Gras <span class="price">$15</span><br /><small
          >This dish has been on the menu longer than anyone in the show Euphoria has been alive. They pound a couple of layers of yellowtail until
          all that’s left is a sheet as thin as Fruit by the Foot. The fish is then draped over a rectangular, toasted baguette topped with foie gras.
          This doesn’t taste as rich as you might currently be thinking, thanks to some incredibly fresh tuna. You should definitely try it.</small

    <div class="desert">
      <p>
        Langoustine <span class="price">$8</span><br /><small
          >We’re still thinking about this dish. Two langoustines (AKA pricey crayfish look-alikes who grow up in saltwater) sit on top of buttery
          fennel-leek compote and a pool of uni sauce Americaine. Between the cayenne in the sauce and the brininess of the shellfish and the uni,
          this tastes like something out of the New Orleans cooking universe. It’s one of the more luxurious-feeling dishes, especially since
          langoustine is only fished in certain parts of Europe.</small
